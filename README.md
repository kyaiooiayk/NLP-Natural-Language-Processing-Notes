## A note on the notebooks rendering
Each notebook has two versions (all python scripts are unaffected by this):
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in black & white. These are placed in the folder named `GitHub_MD_rendering` where MD stands for MarkDown.
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in coloured background.

## Python Libraries
- [CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) is an extremely popular library for Natural Language Processing tasks, built by the Stanford NLP community – they also actively maintain the framework. On the contrary to NLTK and SpaCy, which were written in either Python or Cython respectively, CoreNLP is in Java – meaning that your computer will need to have JDK (but it does have APIs for most programming languages). 
- [gensim](https://pypi.org/project/gensim/) Gensim is a Python library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora. Target audience is the natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) community.
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) (Natural Language ToolKit is one of the leading platforms for building Python programs to process and analyze human language data. The NLTK  documentation states that ‘It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum.’) 
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) is a widely used python library with a comprehensive feature set for fast text processing in multiple languages.
- [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) is a python library that provides a simple API for common NLP tasks and builds on the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) and the Pattern web mining libraries. TextBlob facilitates part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and others.
